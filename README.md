# Rogue-Pickings

Hi there! This is a project I did from Skillcrush. I was tasked with coding up a website from a PSD file. You can take a look at the static version here: https://veemae.github.io/Rogue-Pickings/.
Later on, I created the responsive version of this site, which you can see here: https://veemae.github.io/rogue-pickings-responsive/.
